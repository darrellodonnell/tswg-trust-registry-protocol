# ToIP Approved Deliverable Process Timeline {#toip-approved-deliverable-process-timeline}

The goal of this process is to provide timely review of a request from a ToIP Working Group (WG) to the ToIP Steering Committee (SC) to approve a WG Approved Deliverable as a ToIP Approved Deliverable.

## Initiation {#initiation}

The WG MAY request either standard (recommended) or expedited review. Either way, the process begins as follows:

1. The WG MUST follow the process on [this ToIP wiki page](https://lf-toip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/22996901/Stages+of+Development+for+Working+Groups+Task+Forces) to complete and approve a WG Approved Deliverable.  
2. The WG MUST complete the [Request for Initiation of Approved Deliverable Process](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-PX648W62NaDjV65y4xdZiJ_PubVVBhbeOUILrAtR80dq5Q/viewform)  
3. The WG MUST prepare the [Review Package](#review-package).  
4. The WG MUST submit the Review Package to the SC chairs and request either standard or expedited review.

## Standard Review {#standard-review}

The standard process takes at least 30 days, i.e., two SC meeting cycles (the SC normally meets monthly). The process may take 60 days or longer depending on the number of review cycles.

1. In the first SC meeting after the Review Package is received, the SC MUST appoint a [Review Committee](#review-committee).  
2. The Review Committee SHALL proceed with the [Review Process](#review-process).  
3. If the Review Process can be completed in one SC meeting cycle, the Review Committee SHALL submit the [Review Committee Report](#review-committee-report) back to the SC prior to the next meeting at least 3 business days before the SC meeting (to give the SC members time to review the report prior to the meeting).  
4. If the Review Committee Report recommends approval and the SC is satisfied with the Review Committee Report:  
   1. The SC SHALL proceed with a vote to approve.  
5. If the Review Committee Report recommends approval but the SC is not satisfied with the Review Committee Report:  
   1. The SC SHALL give instructions to the Review Committee about what remediations are necessary to achieve approval.  
   2. The process repeats from step 2\.  
6. If the Review Committee Report does not recommend approval:  
   1. The SC SHALL discuss with the Review Committee Report what remediations are necessary to achieve approval.  
   2. The Review Committee SHALL instruct the WG about those remediations.  
   3. When the WG has made the remediations, the process repeats from step 2\.

## 

## Expedited Review {#expedited-review}

The expedited process is the same as the standard process except:

1. The WG MAY request one or more special meetings of the SC to appoint the Review Committee, review the Review Committee Report, and hold the final vote.  
2. Those meetings MAY take place via email ballots.

| Because a special SC meeting—whether in person or via email ballot—requires at least one week’s notice, and the Review Process requires at least two meetings, the minimum duration for the expedited review process is two weeks. |

# Public Review {#public-review}

1. Prior to final WG approval of a WG deliverable, the WG MUST hold a Public Review of at least 30 calendar days as defined by the process on [this ToIP wiki page](https://lf-toip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/22996901/Stages+of+Development+for+Working+Groups+Task+Forces).   
2. All comments received during the Public Review process MUST be resolved to the WG’s satisfaction.  
3. If enough substantial changes are made to the deliverable as a result of the Public Review process, it MUST undergo another Public Review round of at least 15 calendar days.

# Review Package {#review-package}

The WG SHALL make an official request for approval to the SC co-chairs by submitting the Review Package. 

The Review Package MUST include:

1. A link to the WG Approved Deliverable on GitHub (including both the HTML and Markdown versions of the deliverable if applicable).  
2. A summary of major changes since the previous version (if applicable).  
3. A report on the feedback received during the Public Review process(es), and how any feedback was resolved.  
4. Notice as to whether standard or expedited review is requested (together with any relevant dates or deadlines such as industry conferences).  
5. Proposed members of the Review Committee, including any proposed external experts who are recommended to participate in the review. *The more complete, independent, and authoritative this group, the higher the likelihood of approval.*  
6. A WG-prepared draft of the Review Committee Report and Review Committee Checklist. *The more complete these drafts, the less work required of the Review Committee and the faster the Review Process will go.*

# 

# Review Committee {#review-committee}

The Steering Committee SHALL authorize a Review Committee.

1. The Review Committee MUST be chaired by a member of the Steering Committee who will be tasked with overseeing the Review Committee Report.  
2. The Review Committee MUST consist of at least three members including the chair.  
3. Membership MUST be drawn from both ToIP membership and invited experts.  
   1. Membership from ToIP and LFDT members MUST be solicited via an email announcing the Review Committee.  
   2. Membership MUST include invited experts with relevant expertise who were not directly involved in the WG.   
   3. The invited experts MUST include experts from the problems and requirements space and from the solutions space.  
4. The Review Committee MUST keep the SC appraised of progress via emails to the SC mailing list and/or Discord channel and at SC meetings.

# Review Process {#review-process}

1. The Review Committee MUST self-organize and proceed with whatever process it deems most efficient and effective to produce the [Review Committee Report](#review-committee-report) within the requested [review process timeline](#toip-approved-deliverable-process-timeline).  
2. The Review Committee MUST request the invited experts to review the content of the deliverable most relevant to their expertise.  
3. The final deliverable of the Review Committee MUST be the [Review Committee Report](#review-committee-report), including the [Review Committee Checklist](#review-committee-checklist).  
4. If there are more than one spec submitted for review within a similar or constrained scope, the Review Committee SHALL batch them into one [Review Committee Report](#review-committee-report) upon their discretion, with one [Review Committee Checklist](#review-committee-checklist) submitted per spec. There MUST always be one checklist per spec, no matter the structure of the [Review Committee Report](#review-committee-report).

# Review Committee Report {#review-committee-report}

The Review Committee Report MUST use [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTv9rAU6Y2HW3jlEJn12pzvY7xuXZCpNQ27zo5CHVzUJL9Ww/viewform) and include the following sections (even if only a single sentence):
